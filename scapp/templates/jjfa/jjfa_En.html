						<p>With the number of various types of self-service equipments in all commercial banks increasing in recent years, how to effectively manage these devices is a problem placed in front of each bank that can not be ignored. Self-service operations management involves many links.</p>
						<p>Currently involved in major aspects of business operations are manual, inefficient, high strength and easy to work errors, standardize business operations and refinement operations more difficult, is not conducive to long-term business development and operational risk control. Smaller scale in the operation manual can basically meet the business needs, but with the self-expanding scale operations, operations management difficulty and complexity also will increase, you need to have a new and efficient way to solve operational problems to improve the operation and management of all aspects of work efficiency, enhance operational standardization and refinement, with external constraints to control operational risk, which is buffet business a solid foundation for long-term development, to further improve the level of self-service operations management.</p>
						<p>These management issues for banks, we learn from foreign Cardpay company's advanced self-service device management experience, combined with China's actual operating characteristics of commercial banks, developed a set of completely independent intellectual property rights of independent device management system, which will Bank self-service equipment for operation and maintenance management to bring effective help.</p>
						<p class="step">Self-service device management platform technology content:</p>
						<p>First of all is to raise the event monitoring and management capabilities. Can ATM network safe and stable operation, is most concerned about banks, while reducing downtime, reduce maintenance time, the bank realized the premise of maximizing ATM uptime. Therefore, to achieve the ATM network monitoring of the situation is very critical. The set of ATM operations management system has event management capabilities to the ATM and repair throughout the operational cycle track progress, receive ATM or network status messages sent by all, thus effectively improving event monitoring and management capabilities.</p>
						<p>Second of all enhance the ATM customer relationship management capabilities.
